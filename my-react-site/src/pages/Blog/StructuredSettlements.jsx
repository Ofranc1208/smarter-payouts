              <strong>Structured settlements</strong> are long-term payment arrangements, usually awarded after a personal injury or civil lawsuit. Instead of a lump sum, the recipient receives regular payments over time—monthly, quarterly, or annually. Structured settlements are designed to provide financial stability and security for the future.

            <h2 className="mt-4">A Brief History of Structured Settlements</h2>
            <p>
              Structured settlements became popular in the United States after the 1982 Periodic Payment Settlement Act, which encouraged their use for personal injury cases. They are now a common solution for accident victims, lottery winners, and others who need long-term financial support.

            <h2 className="mt-4">How Do Structured Settlements Work?</h2>
            <p>
              A structured settlement is typically funded by an annuity purchased from a highly rated insurance company. The terms are set by the court and cannot be changed without court approval. Payments are guaranteed and can be tailored to meet the recipient's needs.
